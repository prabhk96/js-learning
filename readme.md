# variables
A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

**There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).**

- Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.

- After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.

- JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
